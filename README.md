Also, this comment from the web documentation about console.log()

> Don't use console.log(obj), use console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))).

> This way you are sure you are seeing the value of obj at the moment you log it. 

> Otherwise, many browsers provide a live view that constantly updates as values change. This may not be what you want.
